# Chance of Admission Prediction Project

This repository contains code for predicting the chance of admission using Python. The prediction model is built using the Pandas library. 

## About the Project
The Chance of Admission Prediction project aims to provide a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of an applicant being admitted to a university based on certain features such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rankings, etc. This can be useful for both prospective students to assess their chances of admission and for universities to analyze applicant data.
